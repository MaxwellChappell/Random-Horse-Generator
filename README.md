<h2>About</h2>
This is a project I had been wanting to make for awhile that selects a 
random horse from my horse list I have been scrapping with name_collector.py in <a href="https://github.com/MaxwellChappell/HorseNameRebuild">HorseNameRebuild</a>
and takes that name and scraps some information from their pedigree page, and then makes a post to tumblr. I have it set up on a Raspberry Pi to run every hour with cron.
